# Algorithms for generating MCC and UCM networks

This is a MATLAB implementation of the algorithm described in our publication (in press at Phys. Rev. X). The following files are included:

- [M_nk.m]: function M(n,k) defined in the paper
- k_nm.m: number k_{n,m} defined in the paper
- mcc_network.m: construction of MCC networks
- ucm_network.m (construction of UCM networks)
- mcc_inf.m (the limit of n = infinity in Eq. (15) of the paper)
- complement.m (network complement)
- demo_ucm_mcc.m (example UCM and MCC networks)
- demo_fig3.m (plot in Fig. 3 of the paper)
- demo_fig4.m (plots in Fig. 4 of the paper)
